# Project Title: My Gallery

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**

## Description
This project showcases a beautiful and minimalist **Image Gallery** created with HTML and CSS. The gallery provides an elegant layout to display multiple images, each accompanied by a caption, allowing users to enjoy a visually appealing experience. The design incorporates smooth animations and responsive elements that enhance the interactivity and visual quality of the gallery.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Grid Layout**  
   The gallery uses CSS Flexbox to create a responsive layout, ensuring that images are well-arranged across different screen sizes. Images are displayed in a structured grid format that adjusts based on the deviceâ€™s viewport.

- **Hover Effects and Animations**  
   Each image card features a grayscale filter that transitions to color on hover. Additionally, smooth scaling and shadow effects are applied when images are hovered over, adding a dynamic feel to the gallery and enhancing user engagement.

- **Image Captions and Styling**  
   Each image includes a caption that appears subtly, giving context to the image. Hovering over the caption or image brings out an interactive font and color change, adding a refined, polished touch to the gallery.

- **Scrollable and User-Friendly**  
   The gallery container is scrollable for convenient navigation through large collections of images, allowing users to easily view and appreciate the entire gallery.

This **Image Gallery** project serves as a visually appealing and interactive space, suitable for photography portfolios or artistic showcases. The smooth animations, subtle effects, and polished design make it a pleasant and engaging experience for users.
